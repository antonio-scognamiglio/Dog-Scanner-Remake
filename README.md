It is a small iOS project that uses `CoreML` and `ImagePicker`. You can either select a photo from the gallery or take a new one with the camera, then the chosen photo will be analyzed and compared with the data in the `StudentDogModel`, finally the result will be shown indicating the possible dog breeds and its accuracy percentages.

### Acknowledgements
The `StudentDogModel` used in this project was taken from the following repository:
